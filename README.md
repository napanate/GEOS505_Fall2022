## SMART Goals
Letter | Description
----------|----------
S | Specific 
M | Measurable
A | Achievable
R | Relevant
T | Time-Bound



#### Goal 1: I want to be able to use Python to analyze datasets and produce clear figures
Letter | Description
----------|----------
S | I have lots of data to analyze and I would like to use Python for this work
M | I will use Python to produce a figure in this class
A | This class will teach me how to use Python to create figures
R | Learning how to use Python to produces figures is a big part of geoscience work today
T | This class ends at the end of the semester

#### Goal 2: Get better at navigating repos/Github
Letter | Description
----------|----------
S | I will create a .readme using Markdown
M | By the end I will have a .readme file that I can share
A | It is only one file so I think I can do it!
R | Github is a useful tool for data sharing and version control
T | This class ends at the end of the semester

#### Goal 3: Design a Climate Dashboard 
Letter | Description
----------|----------
S | Work with a team to design a climate dashboard template
M | Share template design with the class
A | Existing dashboards can be used to guide this process so I won't have to start from scratch
